## Quick summary

**LED Grid Builder** is a browser-based tool to design and preview LED matrix displays built from **MAX7219** modules. You choose the module type (e.g. 8×8, 8×32, 32×32), how many modules and how they’re arranged, the LED color, then add **text**, **icons**, or **your own drawn pattern**. You can preview **static**, **blinking**, and **scrolling** behaviour and adjust fit and speed. The app does not generate firmware or code; it is for visual layout and content preview only.
